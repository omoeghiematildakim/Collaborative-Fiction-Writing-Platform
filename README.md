# Decentralized Collaborative Fiction Writing Platform (StoryDAO)

A blockchain-based platform enabling collaborative storytelling through decentralized governance, transparent contribution tracking, and fair revenue distribution.

## Overview

StoryDAO revolutionizes collaborative fiction writing by creating a decentralized ecosystem where authors can collectively create stories, vote on narrative directions, and receive fair compensation for their contributions. The platform combines creative writing with blockchain technology to ensure transparent attribution and automated royalty distribution.

## Core Components

### Story Contract

The Story Contract manages the fundamental story structure:

- Story initialization and metadata management
- Chapter organization and sequencing
- Genre and content rating classification
- Version control and story branching
- Story state management (draft, review, published)
- Content licensing and rights management
- Story completion criteria
- Character database management

### Contribution Contract

The Contribution Contract handles writer submissions:

- Submission processing and validation
- Content moderation queuing
- Attribution tracking
- Edit history maintenance
- Collaborative editing tools
- Plagiarism detection
- Content formatting standards
- Writer reputation system

### Voting Contract

The Voting Contract enables community-driven storytelling:

- Plot direction proposals
- Character development voting
- Community feedback collection
- Voting power calculation
- Time-locked voting periods
- Stake-weighted decisions
- Alternative plot exploration
- Emergency plot resolution

### Royalty Distribution Contract

The Royalty Distribution Contract manages financial aspects:

- Revenue sharing calculations
- Automated payment distribution
- Contribution weight assessment
- Payment history tracking
- Multiple currency support
- Tax documentation generation
- Dispute resolution process
- Secondary market royalties
